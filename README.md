# Contact Book in Python
This is a beginner-friendly **Contact Book project** written in Python. It allows you to **add**, **view**, **search**, **delete**, and **save contacts** to a text file.
---
## Features
- Add a new contact (Name + Number)
- View all saved contacts in a beautiful table format
- Search contact by name (case-insensitive)
- Delete contact by name
- Save all contacts to a text file (`contacts.txt`)
## How It Works
- All contacts are stored in a **list of dictionaries**
- Contacts can be stored with:
  - `"NAME"`: Contact Name
  - `"CONTACT"`: Phone Number
- You can interact with the program using a simple **menu-driven interface**
